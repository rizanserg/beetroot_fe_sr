                <p class="text-section">Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for
                    environment setup
                    instructions,
                    they've moved to <u>their own section</u>. Continue reading for an introduction to the
                    documentation,
                    Native Components, React, and more!</p>

                <h2 class="text-title">CORE COMPONENTS <sup><small class="chapter">Chapter 2</small></sup></h2>
                <p class="text-section">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
                    applications using React and the
                    app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs
                    APIs
                    as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <em>bundles of
                        reusable, nestable code.</em> You can learn more about React in the next section. But first,
                    let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-title">REACT FUNDAMENTALS <sup><small class="chapter">Chapter 3</small></sup></h2>
                <p class="text-section">React Native runs on <u>React,</u> a popular open source library for building
                    user
                    interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself.
                    This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
                <p class="text-section">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                <p class="text-section"><b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                    examples:
                    friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                <p class="text-section"><b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                    elements inside JavaScript like so:<span>&ltText&gtHello, I am your cat!&lt/Text&gt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="text-section">The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn
                    even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
                    <span>name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
                    <span>&ltText&gt</span>
                </p>
                <p class="text-section"><b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
                <p class="text-section"><b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure
                    how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for
                    handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction.
                    State gives your components memory!</p>

                <h2 class="text-title">HANDLING TEXT INPUT <sup><small class="chapter">Chapter 4</small></sup></h2>
                <p class="text-section">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an
                    onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and
                    an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
                <p class="text-section">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words
                    into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï.
                    So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
