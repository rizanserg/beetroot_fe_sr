                <h2>Ice cream</h2>
                <p>Ice cream (also called ice) is a frozen dessert made mainly from <br>
                    milk, cream, butter, sugar with added flavouring and fragrance, <br>
                    various fruits and berries are also added. <br>
                    Ice cream can also be made with fruit (based on the juice and pulp of fruits and berries). <br>
                    Such ice cream is called sorbet.</p>

                    <h3>Nutritional value</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Ice cream as a dairy product has more than 100 nutrients. It contains proteins, fats,
                        carbohydrates, <br>
                        and a set of vitamins (A, B1, B2, B12, C, D, E, P). The amount of vitamin C increases with the
                        addition <br>
                        of fruit filling. Ice cream ingredients contribute to the production of serotonin in the body.
                        Dairy ice cream <br>
                        contains a lot of tryptophan, a natural calming agent. Ice cream has a high nutritional value,
                        which is why <br>
                        it is recommended for patients after abdominal surgery, peptic ulcer disease (especially if
                        there is bleeding), <br>
                        anaemia, and tuberculosis. However, it should not be consumed excessively in case of
                        atherosclerosis, obesity, <br>
                        hypertension, and gastritis. <br>
                        Ice cream is one of the safest foods. Its ingredients are subject to disinfection (which means
                        that all harmful <br>
                        microorganisms are killed). In addition, the mixture is then chilled, which inhibits the
                        development of microorganisms, <br>
                        including harmful ones. But, like all dairy products, ice cream spoils quickly when it is warm.

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Several nations can compete for the right to be called the parents of ice cream. First and
                        foremost, <br>
                        the Chinese - they were the first to make sweet ice, the recipe for which was kept a strict
                        secret. <br>
                        The Chinese believed that the crafts of silk and ice cream production would bring them world
                        fame. <br>
                        With silk, they succeeded. But they were wrong about ice cream. The Arabs, Indians, and Iranians
                        adopted <br>
                        this remedy from the Chinese. <br>
                        In the fourth century BC. Alexander the Great, who could not stand the heat, used to drink fruit
                        juices with <br>
                        snow delivered by slaves from the mountain peaks. <br>
                        The Roman Emperor Nero (1st century AD) was also fond of ice cream. <br>
                        In Russia, where no one knew anything about Chinese ice cream either, a method of preparing a
                        cold dessert <br>
                        became widespread: frozen milk was finely chopped and mixed with fresh berries. A little later,
                        they started <br>
                        freezing cottage cheese and cream and adding dried raisins or apricots. <br>
                        In the 13th century, the Italian traveller Marco Polo brought to Europe several ways to prepare
                        this previously <br>
                        unknown dish. In the summer of 1660, Italian Francesco Procopio opened an ice cream shop in
                        Paris and became <br>
                        the first European ice cream maker. Soon, ice cream conquered the world. <br>
                        In 1750, France began producing this dish, which quickly became a year-round favourite. <br>
                        In the United States, the first mention of public ice cream sales dates back to May 1777. Its
                        production grew <br>
                        rapidly at the end of the 19th century, when advanced refrigeration machines were introduced.
                        <br>
                        In short, ice cream is an international product. The Slavs introduced various fillers to the way
                        the dish was prepared, <br>
                        Western Europe invented many industrial methods of its production, and the Americans came up
                        with the idea of making <br>
                        waffle cups and ice cream (ice cream on a stick, glazed with chocolate). <br>
                        In 1851, dairy farmer Jacob Fussell established the world's first industrial ice cream
                        production in Baltimore.
